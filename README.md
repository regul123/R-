# Statistics in R

This repository hosts collaborative projects completed with my university colleagues in the field of mathematical statistics. 

It contains 3 projects, each encompassing data generation, data cleaning, analysis, and data visualization. Two formats of each project are available for review: RMD, allowing for the reading of created algorithms, and documentation in HTML format.
